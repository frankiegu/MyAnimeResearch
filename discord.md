tagpls has some generated images re-tags plan?
the paper
2012.04842
(styleflow)2008.02401
https://github.com/gitlabspy/styleflow/issues/1
And it requires bunch of classifier to label those w/images

collect the these generated waifu corresponding to Semantic map,Attributes,etc..
do the attributes conditional, fine-detailed generation, other more task

don't use danbooru raw data as generation dataset 
(because the copyright issue, will not pass on conference paper. Synthesis not that issue)



I think the design purpose(thisXdoesnotexist) is Scientifily exploring , not random
Home page does not need full resolution image display at all, can use thumbnails / sprites
The seed number like the book catalog, select a seed and slider the psi (like slider.html)
just keep random to order
 not only showcase 
About the exploratory websites -> a ranking site
the synthesize waifu can index just like
make a ID database(https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/)
Other more
with Can comment, Voting,  recommend(more seed)
make thisXdoesnotexist like a ranking site(like anime ranking site https://anilist.co/)
this will keep more user using site, Instead of posting everywhere:OhISee:
 Collecting such data from user will helps to do other research 
(Don't be satisfied with just random generation:Amusing: )
before is a pity(in 2018 TWDNE ,2019 waifulab)
don't wasted opportunity to collect dataset
the Crypko (makegirlsmoe team) Collecting A large collection of user Preferred.
So they achieve better Generating quality, just Humans based Distillation

~ I remember if it was openmind or openai or facebook, they made a large scale active learning NLP model and achieved better results ~

crowdsourcing are great !(fig. HumanGAN), Active learning more better:nyan:
